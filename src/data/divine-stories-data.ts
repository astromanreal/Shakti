Mahishasura had conquered heaven and terrorized the worlds after gaining a boon of invincibility from men and gods. The gods, unable to defeat him, manifested their energies into a singular warrior goddess—Durga—who rode a lion and fought Mahishasura for nine days. On the tenth day (Vijaya Dashami), she beheaded him, restoring dharma and balance to the cosmos.",

Unable to bear the disrespect shown to her beloved, she immolated herself in the yagna fire. Enraged by this, Shiva created Virabhadra from a lock of his hair, who destroyed Daksha's yagna and beheaded him. Later, Shiva forgave Daksha and revived him. He then carried Sati's burnt body across the cosmos, and wherever her body parts fell, sacred Shakti Peethas were formed.",
